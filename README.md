Setup and Data Loading:
Libraries imported: pandas, altair, prophet, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn.
The dataset (sales_data.csv) is loaded into a pandas DataFrame with ISO-8859-1 encoding.
Initial exploration includes displaying the first 5 rows of the raw data and DataFrame information (e.g., column names, data types, and non-null counts).
The dataset contains 2,823 entries with 25 columns, including ORDERNUMBER, QUANTITYORDERED, PRICEEACH, SALES, ORDERDATE, PRODUCTLINE, CUSTOMERNAME, DEALSIZE, etc. Some columns (e.g., ADDRESSLINE2, STATE, POSTALCODE, TERRITORY) have missing values.
Data Preprocessing:
The ORDERDATE column is converted to a datetime format using pd.to_datetime with mixed format handling and day-first parsing.
The data is aggregated by ORDERDATE, summing the SALES column to create a time-series dataset (df_agg) with 252 entries, containing two columns: ORDERDATE (datetime) and SALES (float64).
Data Exploration:
The notebook prints the first 5 rows and info of the aggregated DataFrame to confirm the structure and data types.
The aggregated data represents total sales per order date, suitable for time-series analysis.
Visualization:
A line chart is created using Altair to visualize total sales over time, with ORDERDATE on the x-axis and SALES on the y-axis. The chart includes tooltips for date and sales values and allows interactive zooming/panning.
A scatter plot is generated using matplotlib and seaborn to compare actual vs. predicted sales for a linear regression model. The plot includes a diagonal reference line and is saved as actual_vs_predicted_sales_regression.png.
Predictive Modeling:
The notebook includes code for a linear regression model (using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression) to predict sales, with y_test (actual sales) and y_pred (predicted sales) used for visualization.
Performance metrics (mean_squared_error, r2_score) are imported but not shown in the provided code snippet.
The Prophet library is imported, suggesting potential time-series forecasting, though the relevant code is not included in the provided excerpt.
